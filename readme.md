*Ah shit, here we go again...*
...It's **Yet Another Shield Core Addon (YASCA)...**

## What?
Yet Another Shield Core Addon (YASCA) is an addon for [Hideous Destructor](https://codeberg.org/mc776/hideousdestructor) that, by default, *tries* to replace all Spiritual Armour with Shield Cores, while not overwriting code in the process.

Also adds a counter for keeping track of how much Shield and Spiritual Armour you have. *(both can be toggled)*

Additionally, this addon supports [Of Spirits and Shields](https://dastrukar.gitlab.io/hddons-list/#mutators:ofspiritsandshields-cryomundus).

Should also run with Freedoom. Though, only the HUD will be available. *(unless you're using Of Spirits and Shields)*
